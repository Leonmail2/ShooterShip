Godot 3d game.

Playable prototype for multiplayer shooter. The main focus of this demo is to showcase the feasability of a vehical-based deathmatch game.
Use WASD to move, space to jump, left click to shoot. Upon impact, the cubes will destory you.
Combine your speed with strafing and jumping to shoot off the ramps super high and fast.
The HUD is curretly non-functional, and there are no multiplayer features. The laser, although it doesn't seem to do anything, is implemented fully in code.
